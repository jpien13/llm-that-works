      " First, we need to understand what is an electroencephalogram. An electroencephalogram is a recording of brain activity. It is a recording of brain activity that is made by placing electrodes on the scalp. The electrodes are placed in a way that they are connected to the brain. The electrodes are connected to the brain by wires. The wires are connected to the electrodes by a cable. The cable is connected to a computer. The computer is connected to a monitor. The monitor is connected to a television. The television is connected to a radio. The radio is connected to a speaker. The speaker is connected to a microphone.
